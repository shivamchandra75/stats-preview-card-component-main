## My process

-I used grid for aligning items here and to preserve my layout
-added media queries to make the website responsive
-learned a lot in the process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about the background blend mode in css that is used to mix your background image and a background and blend them . when the background is a solid color it gives the image a cool look depending on what property u use like a hue or multply etc...
refer style.css line 37

2.) I learned to make a word from a line to enter a new line there were many methods i chose this <p class="font"><span>10k+</span>COMPANIES</p>
we can target span through css and make it a display block so that the next element or text would enter new line.

3.)when website begins to scroll horizontaly add this

html {
overflow-x: hidden;
}

### Continued development

css grid would be the property that i am curently struggling with and will continue to work on.
